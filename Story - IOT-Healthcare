Internet of Things - Remote Sensing in  Healthcare.

Remote IoT Sensing to improve data collection and transport in hospitals in remote locations with limited internet access.
The project focuses on improving healthcare in developing countries using low power, economic electronics such as the Raspberry Pi (Rpi).

Using devices such as the Raspberry Pi, create a system where data can be transported between remote locations, where internet connection is limited - a physical network of sorts.

The system utilises 3 key components:
1. Nodes that gather data in the field. These are Rpi's used in small clinics in rural towns. 
Each clinic can have a node, or on a larger scale, each hospital room/wing could have a node. 
The node is connected to sensors such as heart monitors, blood pressure monitors, etc. 
I only had access to a webcam so I have modelled this as a sensor to monitor patients movement.

2. Hubs that collect all the data from different nodes and upload it online. 
The hub is located in a major city with internet access.

3. Google or any Cloud Services - This is where the data is uploaded and processed. 
An upcoming technology in the Internet of Things, the Bus is a great messaging service to transport messages 
and large data the Service Bus can then be accessed from anywhere in the world. 
The purpose of doing this is so that the patient data/information can be processed in more developed countries and
feedback can be sent to the individual nodes through the hubs. On a more local scale, 
some of the sensor data could be used to trigger messages on the service bus such as health alerts 
that could be sent to nurses to act upon.


Project 1:

Smart Health Care Monitoring System Based on IoT :

  This project includes hardware which will measure blood pressure, heart rate, ECG & temperature, and send to Android application & Firebase.
